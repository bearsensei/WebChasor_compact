# WebChasor Environment Configuration Example
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual API keys
# 
# SECURITY NOTE: Only sensitive API keys are stored in environment variables.
# All other configuration (models, endpoints, etc.) is in config/config.yaml

# OpenAI API Key (REQUIRED)
OPENAI_API_KEY_AGENT=your_openai_api_key_here

# Search API Keys (OPTIONAL - for IR_RAG functionality)
SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here
GOOGLE_SEARCH_KEY=your_google_search_key_here

# Configuration Notes:
# - API endpoints (like OPENAI_API_BASE) are now in config/config.yaml
# - Model names are now in config/config.yaml
# - All non-sensitive settings are centralized in the config file
# - Only API keys remain in environment variables for security
