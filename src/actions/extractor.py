# Chasor is a system that can extract, calculate, synthesize, retrieve, and reorganize information. Extractor is a class that can extract information from a text. Calculator is a class that can calculate information. Synthesizer is a class that can synthesize information. InfoRetriever is a class that can retrieve information from the search engine or a database. InfoReorganizer is a class that can reorganize the retrieved information into a structured format.
